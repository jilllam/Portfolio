JavaScript Projects
Here are some small projects I made while learning JavaScript.
Projects -Pizza Menu -Tic-Tac-Toe Game -Calculator
Pizza Menu A simple pizza ordering page where users can choose toppings. The program then calculates the total price based on the selections.
Tic-Tac-Toe Game A browser version of the classic tic-tac-toe game. It randomly picks which player goes first, lets players choose their symbols, and shows a fun celebration when someone wins.
Calcuator A basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It has a clean and easy-to-use layout.
